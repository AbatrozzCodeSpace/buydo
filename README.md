##Installation
First of all, my grammar sucks. Please correct it if you found any errors.

Please use XAMPP and Sublime Text 2. Download it from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and [here](www.sublimetext.com/2)

Clone this repo and copy the contents inside to /XAMPP/htdocs/

After that, the contents inside /htdocs can be accessed from [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) in your favorite browser.

##For template creator(s):

###View the template at
http://localhost/buydo/assets/frontend/

If you want to see the example codes, the original files is here: /buydo/assets/frontend/

###To create new template:
1. create new <file_name>.php file at /buydo/application/views/sample_view/
2. preview changes at http://localhost/buydo/index.php/vc/show/<file_name>

###Notes:
When referring codes from the template sample, please replace '../.. with '<?php echo base_url(); ?>'
